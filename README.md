# Interactive Cursor Mini-Project

Welcome to the Interactive Cursor Mini-Project! This project showcases a small and interactive cursor implemented using JavaScript DOM manipulation and a touch of GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform).

## Overview

The Interactive Cursor project is a small yet engaging demonstration where a dynamic circle follows the user's mouse movements, providing a visually pleasing cursor effect. GSAP is employed to introduce smooth animations, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript:** Utilized for DOM manipulation and dynamic cursor positioning.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** Incorporated for smooth and fluid animations.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Basic HTML structure for the project.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling and positioning elements.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the logic for cursor behavior.

## Features

- **Dynamic Cursor:** A small circle follows the user's mouse movements in real-time.
- **GSAP Animations:** Smooth animations improve the visual appeal of the cursor.

## How to Run the Project Locally

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
